                <p>Jenkins the Valet, which started out as Ape #1798 in the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) Collection is the face of a new kind of media company, where IP is managed via NFTs. Tally Labs LLC turned Ape #1798 into a character called Jenkins the Valet, and plans to create a connected set Intellectual Property assets which people can interact with via NFTs.</p>
                <br />
                <p>The right to vote on the plot of their first product - a book - has been sold via a set of NFTs called the Writers Room. The 6,942 NFTs in this collection have sold 10,328 times with a total volume of 4,347.37 ETH. Revenue is generated mainly from a 5% royalty on secondary sales. This will be supplemented in the future with new media sales and licensing. Finally a partnership with CAA lets Tally Labs access a wide array of artists who can power the creation of a diversified content universe.</p>
